# ideaService Specification

## Overview

Business logic service for working with GitHub-backed ideation records. It resolves ideas through the GitHub-backed idea service, manages lifecycle transitions, and optionally uses the configured LLM provider to match ready ideas against a transcript.

**Source:** `src/L3-services/ideation/ideaService.ts`

## Behavioral Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| REQ-001 | `getIdeasByIds()` returns the persisted ideas for the requested IDs in the same order as the input array and throws `Idea not found: {id}` when any ID is missing. | P0 |
| REQ-002 | `getReadyIdeas()` returns only ideas whose `status` is `ready`. | P0 |
| REQ-003 | `markRecorded()` updates an idea to `status = 'recorded'`, stores the provided `sourceVideoSlug`, and persists the change. | P0 |
| REQ-004 | `markPublished()` appends a publish record to `publishedContent`, initializes the array when missing, changes `status` to `published`, and persists the change. | P0 |
| REQ-005 | `matchIdeasToTranscript()` only considers ready ideas, sends the transcript summary plus idea summaries to the configured LLM provider, and returns up to three matched ideas ordered by relevance. | P0 |
| REQ-006 | `matchIdeasToTranscript()` returns an empty array when there are no ready ideas, when the provider is unavailable, or when matching/parsing fails. | P0 |

## Architectural Constraints

| ID | Constraint | Priority |
|----|------------|----------|
| ARCH-001 | `ideaService.ts` may only import from L0, L1, and L2-backed L3 wrappers. | P0 |
| ARCH-002 | Idea persistence must go through `src/L3-services/ideaService/ideaService.ts`. | P0 |
| ARCH-003 | LLM access must go through `src/L3-services/llm/providerFactory.ts` and use a tool-free non-streaming session for transcript matching. | P0 |
